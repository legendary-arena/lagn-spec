# EC-212 — Villain & Henchman Fight + Ambush Effects (Execution Checklist)

**Source:** docs/ai/work-packets/WP-185-villain-fight-and-ambush-effects.md
**Layer:** Game Engine (`packages/game-engine/src/`)

## Before Starting
- [ ] **WP-187 complete ⛔ HARD BLOCKER** — card-data `[effect:]` enrichment. Verify with `grep -rn "\[effect:" data/cards/`; if it returns nothing, **STOP and report `BLOCKED: WP-187`**. Executing against unenriched data produces `effects: []` for every hook and deletes the only Ambush effect that fires today (net regression).
- [ ] WP-009A + WP-009B complete ✅ (rule hook contracts + pipeline)
- [ ] WP-014A + WP-014B complete ✅ (villain reveal pipeline + classification)
- [ ] WP-016 + WP-017 complete ✅ (`fightVillain` move; `koCard` / `gainWound` / bystander helpers)
- [ ] WP-021 + WP-022 complete ✅ (hero ability hook precedent — mirror its shape)
- [ ] WP-025 complete ✅ (`G.cardKeywords`; `buildCardKeywords.ts:detectAmbush`)
- [ ] Read `packages/game-engine/src/rules/heroAbility.types.ts` (precedent for `VillainAbilityHook`)
- [ ] Read `packages/game-engine/src/setup/heroAbility.setup.ts` (precedent for parser)
- [ ] Read `packages/game-engine/src/hero/heroEffects.execute.ts` (precedent for executor + MVP keyword discipline)
- [ ] Read `packages/game-engine/src/moves/fightVillain.ts` (Fight: fire site)
- [ ] Read `packages/game-engine/src/villainDeck/villainDeck.reveal.ts` (Ambush: fire site; lines 203-228 deleted)
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @legendary-arena/game-engine build` exits 0
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @legendary-arena/game-engine test` exits 0 (baseline)

## Locked Values (do not re-derive)
- `VillainAbilityTiming = 'onAmbush' | 'onFight'` — **two entries, this order**. `'onEscape'` is reserved for WP-186 and MUST NOT appear in this WP.
- `VILLAIN_ABILITY_TIMINGS = ['onAmbush', 'onFight'] as const`
- `VillainEffectKeyword` union = exactly five entries: `'gainWoundEachPlayer' | 'gainWoundCurrentPlayer' | 'koHeroCurrentPlayer' | 'heroDeckTopToEscape' | 'captureBystander'`
- `VILLAIN_EFFECT_KEYWORDS` canonical order = `['gainWoundEachPlayer', 'gainWoundCurrentPlayer', 'koHeroCurrentPlayer', 'heroDeckTopToEscape', 'captureBystander']`
- `VillainAbilityHook` interface: `{ cardId: CardExtId; timing: VillainAbilityTiming; keywords: VillainEffectKeyword[]; effects: VillainEffectKeyword[]; }`
- `G.villainAbilityHooks: Readonly<VillainAbilityHook[]>` — new field on `LegendaryGameState`
- **Effect marker token = `[effect:<VillainEffectKeyword>]`** — the only source of executable effects. Validate `<value>` against `VILLAIN_EFFECT_KEYWORDS`; ignore unknown values. Do **not** read `[keyword:]` / `[icon:]` (card-mechanic names + resource icons) and do **not** parse free-text. Markers authored by WP-187.
- **Timing detection from text prefix:** case-insensitive, leading whitespace trimmed; only exact `Ambush:` / `Fight:` prefixes match (v1). One hook per matched ability line.
- **Emission order (stable total order):** (1) `cardId` lexical asc, (2) `timing` per `VILLAIN_ABILITY_TIMINGS`, (3) ability-line index in `abilities[]`.
- **`keywords` === `effects`** in v1 (identical arrays; both kept for `HeroAbilityHook` parity).
- `koHeroCurrentPlayer` auto-resolution order: **zone priority (discard before hand), then `ext_id` lexical ascending**; silent no-op if neither zone has a hero. **NOT VP-based** — per-card hero VP is not in engine runtime state (`G.cardStats` has `attack`/`recruit`/`cost`/`fightCost` only); no registry read at runtime.
- Henchman ability text source: **group-level** `group.abilities[]` — fans out to every card-instance ext_id within the group
- Ambush dispatch is gated by `hasAmbush(cardId, G.cardKeywords ?? {})` — keep the fast pre-check
- Fight: fire site order: **after** bystander award, **before** message push, in `fightVillain.ts`
- Fight: `captureBystander` **awards the captured bystander immediately** (post-award fire site would otherwise strand it)
- Hardcoded `gainWound` Ambush placeholder at `villainDeck.reveal.ts:203-228` is **deleted**, not gated

## Guardrails
- No `@legendary-arena/registry` import in `villainAbility.types.ts`, `villainAbility.setup.ts`, or `villainEffects.execute.ts`
- No `boardgame.io` import in `villainAbility.types.ts` or `villainEffects.execute.ts`
- No `.reduce()` for multi-step branching; use `for...of` with descriptive loop variables
- Moves never throw — `executeVillainAbilities` returns `void` and silently no-ops on unknown effects
- Out-of-vocabulary effects safely no-op — no `console.warn`, no throw, no message push
- Per-copy hook objects are freshly constructed (no shared references across card-instance ext_ids per D-13502)
- Setup parser must handle henchman group-level ability text — read `group.abilities[]`, emit one hook per card-instance ext_id in the group
- Structured effect tokens MUST be parsed only from `[effect:<VillainEffectKeyword>]` markup; `[keyword:]` / `[icon:]` namespaces and free-text MUST NOT produce executable effects
- In v1, `keywords` and `effects` MUST be identical arrays (schema parity with hero hooks)
- Setup parser MUST emit hooks in deterministic order: (1) cardId lexical, (2) timing order, (3) ability index
- Ability prefix detection MUST be case-insensitive with leading whitespace trimmed; only exact `Ambush:` / `Fight:` match
- VP for KO resolution MUST NOT be read — order by zone (discard→hand) then ext_id lexical; no registry lookup
- `captureBystander` during `onFight` MUST immediately award the captured bystander to the current player after attachment
- `G.villainAbilityHooks` is JSON-serializable — no functions, no Maps, no Sets, no class instances
- Drift-detection tests are mandatory for both canonical arrays; bidirectional union ↔ array assertion

## Required `// why:` Comments
- `VILLAIN_ABILITY_TIMINGS` declaration: why drift-detection array exists (must match union exactly; adding `'onEscape'` requires WP-186)
- `VILLAIN_EFFECT_KEYWORDS` declaration: why this five-keyword vocabulary is the MVP lock (WP-185 §Non-Negotiable Constraints; expansion = future WP)
- `villainAbility.setup.ts` henchman group-level fan-out loop: why one ability text becomes N hooks (group-level shape in registry data; each card-instance ext_id needs its own hook entry per D-13502)
- `villainEffects.execute.ts` `koHeroCurrentPlayer` auto-resolution helper: why deterministic zone-priority (discard→hand) + `ext_id` lexical order, and why **not** VP-based (per-card VP not in engine runtime state; interactive choice deferred per WP-185 §Out of Scope)
- `villainEffects.execute.ts` `captureBystander` onFight branch: why the captured bystander is awarded immediately (post-award fire site would strand it on a victory-pile card)
- `villainEffects.execute.ts` out-of-vocabulary switch default: why silent no-op rather than warn or throw (move contract — moves never throw; matches WP-022 hero-effects precedent for unsupported keywords)
- `fightVillain.ts` insertion point: why after bystander award and before message push (effects observe post-award pile state; Fight `captureBystander` then awards immediately to avoid stranding)
- `villainDeck.reveal.ts` Ambush replacement: why the hardcoded `gainWound` loop is deleted (per D-18504; D-2403 safe-skip note superseded for Ambush case)

## Files to Produce
- `packages/game-engine/src/rules/villainAbility.types.ts` — **new** — timing + effect keyword unions, canonical arrays, `VillainAbilityHook` interface, `getVillainHooksForCard` pure filter
- `packages/game-engine/src/setup/villainAbility.setup.ts` — **new** — structural `VillainAbilityRegistryReader`; `buildVillainAbilityHooks(registry, matchConfig)` produces hook table; timing from `Ambush:` / `Fight:` prefix, effects from `[effect:]` markers validated against `VILLAIN_EFFECT_KEYWORDS`; handles villain per-card AND henchman group-level shapes; deterministic emission order
- `packages/game-engine/src/villain/villainEffects.execute.ts` — **new** — `executeVillainAbilities(G, ctx, cardId, timing)`; per-keyword switch; safe-skip default
- `packages/game-engine/src/types.ts` — **modified** — add `villainAbilityHooks: Readonly<VillainAbilityHook[]>` to `LegendaryGameState`; re-export new types
- `packages/game-engine/src/setup/buildInitialGameState.ts` — **modified** — one new line: `G.villainAbilityHooks = buildVillainAbilityHooks(registry, matchConfig);` in the composition block
- `packages/game-engine/src/moves/fightVillain.ts` — **modified** — add `executeVillainAbilities(G, ctx, cardId, 'onFight')` after Step 3b, before message push
- `packages/game-engine/src/villainDeck/villainDeck.reveal.ts` — **modified** — replace lines 203-228 (hardcoded ambush wound loop) with a single `executeVillainAbilities(G, { ctx }, cardId, 'onAmbush')` call gated by `hasAmbush(...)`
- `packages/game-engine/src/rules/villainAbility.types.test.ts` — **new** — drift-detection (TIMINGS + EFFECT_KEYWORDS); `getVillainHooksForCard` query tests
- `packages/game-engine/src/setup/villainAbility.setup.test.ts` — **new** — Ambush + Fight prefix detection (case/whitespace); henchman group-level fan-out; `[effect:]` marker extraction + validation; `[keyword:]`/`[icon:]`/free-text → empty effects; `keywords === effects` parity; gate-consistency (`onAmbush` hook ⇒ `hasAmbush` true); deterministic emission order
- `packages/game-engine/src/villain/villainEffects.execute.test.ts` — **new** — per-effect-keyword behavior; `captureBystander` onFight immediate-award (no stranded bystander); `koHeroCurrentPlayer` zone+ext_id ordering; fire-site integration via direct calls; safe-skip on empty piles and `effects: []` hooks; deterministic replay

## Common Failure Smells
- Adding `'onEscape'` to `VILLAIN_ABILITY_TIMINGS` "to get a head start on WP-186" → scope-creep FAIL; WP-186 owns that addition
- Wrapping the deleted Ambush hardcode in `if (false)` or a feature flag instead of deleting it → D-18504 violation
- Henchman ability text emitted as one hook for the group rather than fanning out to every card-instance ext_id → D-13502 aliasing precedent violation
- `koHeroCurrentPlayer` using `Math.random()` or seed-less first-card pick → determinism FAIL; auto-resolution must be VP-ascending + ext_id lexical tie-break
- Adding `console.warn` on out-of-vocabulary effects → WP-022 precedent violation; safe-skip means silent
- `executeVillainAbilities` throws on a missing `payload.cardId` or unknown cardId → move-contract FAIL; moves never throw
- Fight: fire site placed before bystander award → ordering FAIL; Fight `captureBystander` would observe pre-award state
- Setup parser reads `@legendary-arena/registry` instead of using local structural `VillainAbilityRegistryReader` → layer-boundary FAIL
- Adding a sixth effect keyword to satisfy a single card → vocabulary-lock violation; safe-skip is the correct response
- Aliasing the same `VillainAbilityHook` object across multiple card-instance ext_ids in a henchman group → D-13502 violation; each ext_id gets a freshly-constructed object literal
- Parser generates effects from free-text or from `[keyword:]` / `[icon:]` tokens rather than `[effect:]` markers → non-deterministic / wrong-namespace behavior; only `[effect:]` is executable
- Parser emits an `onAmbush` hook but `hasAmbush(...)` is false → silent execution drop (gate mismatch); the gate-consistency test must catch this
- `captureBystander` onFight attaches a bystander without awarding it → stranded bystander BUG on a victory-pile card
- `koHeroCurrentPlayer` reaching for VP (registry read, or assuming `G.cardStats.vp`) → layer/scope violation; VP is not in engine runtime state, order by zone + ext_id instead
