# WP-176 — Admin Billing Auth Cutover (requireAdminSecret → requireAdminSession)

**Status:** Drafted 2026-05-24
**Layer:** Server (`apps/server/`)
**EC:** EC-198
**Decisions:** D-17601, D-17602, D-17603 (reserved; landed at execution close)

---

## Goal

Cut over `GET /api/admin/billing/history` from the WP-110 shared-secret
gate (`requireAdminSecret` / `X-Admin-Secret` header) to WP-159's
session-based gate (`requireAdminSession`). The operator (jeff) is the
only admin on production; the cutover is a single commit + redeploy with
no dual-running window.

After execution:
- The route authenticates via Hanko session + `is_admin = TRUE` (per
  WP-159 §A), matching the WP-107 admin profile routes.
- `adminGate.ts` and `adminGate.test.ts` are deleted (no remaining
  callers).
- The `admin-secret` Auth Taxonomy value is removed from
  `api-endpoints.md` (no remaining rows use it).
- The `ADMIN_SECRET` env var on Render is documented as stale (operator
  action to unset post-deploy).

---

## Assumes

- [x] WP-110 — Admin Billing Visibility: shipped, `GET /api/admin/billing/history` is `Wired` in the catalog. D-11001, D-11002.
- [x] WP-159 — Admin Session Gate: shipped 2026-05-17 (`requireAdminSession` in `apps/server/src/auth/adminSession.ts`). D-15901, D-15902.
- [x] WP-107 — Profile Integrity / Anti-Cheat Surface: shipped 2026-05-24. First production caller of `requireAdminSession`. Structural template for the cutover (caller-injected deps, test fixtures, catalog row shape).
- [x] WP-112 — Session Token Validation Middleware: shipped. `requireAuthenticatedSession` orchestrator consumed by `requireAdminSession`.
- [x] WP-131 — Authenticated Routes Production Wiring: shipped. `verifier` + `productionAccountResolver` bindings already in scope at the `server.mjs` registration site.
- [x] WP-126 — External Authentication Integration (Hanko Session Verifier): shipped. Production `createHankoSessionVerifier` wired via WP-131.
- [x] WP-174 — First-Sign-In Auto-Provisioning: shipped 2026-05-24. `productionAccountResolver` is read-or-create; relevant because admin billing queries do NOT need an account row, but the verifier + accountResolver bindings are the same ones threaded through.
- `apps/server/src/auth/adminGate.ts` — sole caller is `adminBilling.routes.ts` (verified via grep).
- `apps/server/src/server.mjs` line 558 — `registerAdminBillingRoutes(server.router, pool)` is the current two-arg call. The `requireAdminSession`, `verifier`, and `accountResolver` bindings are already in scope from lines 572-576 (the `registerAdminProfileRoutes` call).
- `jeff@barefootbetters.com` is the only `is_admin = TRUE` row on production (`legendary.players.ext_id = d3650ed0-afa8-47e1-90d4-401863ee55b5`). Production smoke test of `requireAdminSession` passed 2026-05-24 via `/api/admin/players/nobody/integrity` → 404 with locked body shape.

---

## Scope (In)

### §A — Route handler cutover

Rewrite `registerAdminBillingRoutes` in `adminBilling.routes.ts`:

1. **Signature change:** `(router, database)` → `(router, database, deps)` where `deps: AdminBillingRouteDependencies` mirrors `AdminProfileRouteDependencies` (three fields: `requireAdminSession`, `verifier?`, `accountResolver?`).
2. **Import change:** remove `import { requireAdminSecret } from '../auth/adminGate.js'`; add type-only imports for `AdminSessionResult`, `SessionTokenRequest`, `RequireAuthenticatedSessionOptions`, `SessionVerifier`, `AccountResolver` from the same paths WP-107 uses.
3. **Handler rewrite:** replace the `requireAdminSecret(koaContext.req)` call with `deps.requireAdminSession(koaContext.req, { verifier: deps.verifier, accountResolver: deps.accountResolver, database })`. Dispatch on the result's closed-union code:
   - `ok: true` → proceed to `getAdminBillingHistory(database)`
   - `'unauthorized'` → 401 `{ code: 'unauthorized', reason: result.reason }`
   - `'forbidden'` → 403 `{ code: 'forbidden', reason: result.reason }`
   - `'lookup_failed'` → 500 `{ code: 'internal_error' }`
4. **Error body change:** failure responses gain a `reason` field (the old `{ code: 'unauthorized' }` becomes `{ code: 'unauthorized' | 'forbidden', reason: string }`). The `lookup_failed` code maps to 500 `{ code: 'internal_error' }` — this is distinct from operational faults (catch block), which return `{ error: 'internal_error' }`. Implementers MUST NOT collapse these two 500 shapes; both must exist as separate code paths.
5. **Exhaustive dispatch REQUIRED:** the handler must perform an explicit closed-union dispatch on `result.code`; no default branch, no `if (!result.ok)` short-circuit. All known variants (`ok: true`, `'unauthorized'`, `'forbidden'`, `'lookup_failed'`) must be handled explicitly to prevent silent drift if the union expands.
5. **`Cache-Control: no-store`** remains the first statement (WP-115 D-11504 lock unchanged).
6. **KoaContext type:** the type of `koaContext.req` **at the route handler boundary** must be widened from `IncomingMessage` to `SessionTokenRequest` (the `requireAdminSession` signature requires it). This change must be reflected in the local `KoaAdminBillingContext` interface within `adminBilling.routes.ts`.

### §B — Test rewrite

Rewrite `adminBilling.routes.test.ts`:

1. Remove `beforeEach` / `afterEach` env-var manipulation (`process.env.ADMIN_SECRET`).
2. Import `AdminSessionResult`, `SessionTokenRequest`, `RequireAuthenticatedSessionOptions` types.
3. Define `makeRequireAdminSession(result)` factory — byte-identical to `adminProfile.routes.test.ts`.
4. Define `okSession`, `unauthorizedSession`, `forbiddenSession` fixtures — same three-fixture pattern.
5. Test cases:
   - 200 happy path with `okSession`
   - 401 with `unauthorizedSession` — assert both `code` and `reason` match the fixture value
   - 403 with `forbiddenSession` (**new test** — the old route had no 403 path) — assert both `code` and `reason` match the fixture value
   - Cache-Control no-store on 200 and 401
   - 500 on database fault with `okSession`
   - Cache-Control no-store on 500
6. No `X-Admin-Secret` header in any fixture.

### §C — Server wiring change

In `apps/server/src/server.mjs`:

1. Replace `registerAdminBillingRoutes(server.router, pool)` with the three-arg form:
   ```js
   registerAdminBillingRoutes(server.router, pool, {
     requireAdminSession,
     verifier,
     accountResolver: verifier === undefined ? undefined : productionAccountResolver,
   });
   ```
2. Update the `// why:` comment from the D-11001 shared-secret rationale to a WP-176 / D-17601 cutover rationale.
3. **Structural identity constraint:** the deps object passed to `registerAdminBillingRoutes` must be structurally identical to the one passed to `registerAdminProfileRoutes` within the same file — same field names, same ordering, same conditional expression for `accountResolver`. No divergence is permitted.

### §D — File deletion

Delete:
- `apps/server/src/auth/adminGate.ts`
- `apps/server/src/auth/adminGate.test.ts`

Post-deletion grep verification: `requireAdminSecret` returns 0 hits under `apps/server/src/`. Post-deletion, the project must compile (`pnpm -r build` exits 0) without any missing-import errors referencing `adminGate.*`.

### §E — API catalog update (per §21 + D-11804)

In `docs/ai/REFERENCE/api-endpoints.md`:

1. **Replace the `/api/admin/billing/history` row** (whole-row replacement per D-11804). Auth changes from `admin-secret` to `admin-session-required`. Status-code domain expands from `{200, 401, 500}` to `{200, 401, 403, 500}`. Error body changes from `{ code: 'unauthorized' }` to `{ code: 'unauthorized' | 'forbidden', reason: string }` (closed-union per D-15901). Notes rewrite the gate description.
2. **Auth Taxonomy reduction:** remove the `admin-secret` row from the Auth Taxonomy table. Update the header from "five values" to "four values". Update the `extended by D-11001 +` reference to cite D-17602 for the removal.
3. **Update the `admin-session-required` taxonomy row:** remove the trailing sentence "No endpoint uses this value today." (WP-107 already uses it; WP-176 adds a second caller).
4. **Changelog entry** at the bottom of `api-endpoints.md`.

### §F — DECISIONS entries

Three entries landed at execution close:

- **D-17601** — Admin billing auth cutover: requireAdminSecret → requireAdminSession.
- **D-17602** — Remove `admin-secret` from Auth Taxonomy closed set (5 → 4 values).
- **D-17603** — Delete `adminGate.ts` + `adminGate.test.ts` (clean cutover, no dormant preservation).

---

## Out of Scope

- **Engine / registry / preplan / client changes** — server-only WP.
- **New admin endpoints** — only WP-110's existing route is in scope.
- **Admin CLI for granting subsequent admins** — separate future WP (noted in WP-159 §Scope Out).
- **Touching production database** — jeff's `is_admin = TRUE` row already exists from PS-1 2026-05-24.
- **Touching Render env vars** — operator action documented as a post-merge step, not a code change.
- **Pre-existing `join-match.test.ts` baseline failure** — carried forward; same disposition as WP-159 / WP-107 / WP-174.
- **`adminBilling.logic.ts`** — query logic unchanged; only the route handler's auth gate changes.
- **`adminBilling.types.ts`** — response types unchanged.
- **`billing.types.ts`** — `DatabaseClient` type unchanged.

---

## Files Expected to Change

1. `apps/server/src/billing/adminBilling.routes.ts` — **modified** (§A: signature change + handler rewrite)
2. `apps/server/src/billing/adminBilling.routes.test.ts` — **modified** (§B: full test rewrite)
3. `apps/server/src/server.mjs` — **modified** (§C: three-arg wiring + comment update)
4. `apps/server/src/auth/adminGate.ts` — **deleted** (§D)
5. `apps/server/src/auth/adminGate.test.ts` — **deleted** (§D)
6. `docs/ai/REFERENCE/api-endpoints.md` — **modified** (§E: row replacement + taxonomy reduction + changelog)
7. `docs/ai/DECISIONS.md` — **modified** (§F: D-17601..D-17603 landed)
8. `docs/ai/work-packets/WORK_INDEX.md` — **modified** (WP-176 checked off)

---

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

### Engine-wide (always apply)

- ESM only, Node v22+
- Human-style code per `docs/ai/REFERENCE/00.6-code-style.md`
- Every new or modified file must be written in full — no diffs, no snippets, no "show only the changed section"
- Every function must have a JSDoc comment
- Every `// why:` location documented in EC-198 must be produced verbatim

### Packet-specific

- `adminBilling.logic.ts` is NOT modified — the query layer is untouched
- `adminBilling.types.ts` is NOT modified — the response type contract is untouched
- `adminSession.ts` is NOT modified — the gate is consumed, not changed
- `sessionToken.logic.ts` and `sessionToken.types.ts` are NOT modified
- `auth/hanko/**` is NOT modified
- No new npm dependencies
- No `Math.random()`, no `Date.now()`, no wall-clock reads
- Moves, phases, rules, engine types are not touched (server-only WP)

### Session protocol

- Stop and ask if any file outside the allowlist needs modification
- Stop and ask if any unclear item arises during execution

### Locked contract values

- Route path: `GET /api/admin/billing/history` (unchanged)
- `Cache-Control: no-store` as the first statement of the handler body (D-11504 lock)
- 200 response body: `{ entries: AdminBillingEntry[] }` (unchanged)
- 500 operational-fault body: `{ error: 'internal_error' }` (unchanged)
- Auth failure body shape: `{ code: 'unauthorized' | 'forbidden', reason: string }` (closed-union per D-15901)
- `lookup_failed` maps to 500 `{ code: 'internal_error' }` — distinct from operational-fault 500 `{ error: 'internal_error' }`; both shapes must coexist as separate code paths
- Status-code domain: `{200, 401, 403, 500}`
- `AdminBillingRouteDependencies` interface: three fields (`requireAdminSession`, `verifier?`, `accountResolver?`)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `pnpm test --filter @legendary-arena/server` passes; test count ≥ baseline (441 pass / 1 fail / 66 skip). The 1-fail is the pre-existing `join-match.test.ts` carry-forward.
2. `pnpm -r build` exits 0.
3. `grep -r 'requireAdminSecret' apps/server/src/` returns 0 hits.
4. `grep -r 'adminGate' apps/server/src/` returns 0 hits (files deleted).
5. `grep -r 'X-Admin-Secret' apps/server/src/` returns 0 hits (no header references remain).
6. `grep -r 'admin-secret' docs/ai/REFERENCE/api-endpoints.md` returns 0 hits (taxonomy value removed).
7. `adminBilling.routes.test.ts` contains no `process.env.ADMIN_SECRET` manipulation.
8. `adminBilling.routes.test.ts` contains a 403 test case (new; the old route had no 403 path).
9. `server.mjs` calls `registerAdminBillingRoutes(server.router, pool, { requireAdminSession, verifier, accountResolver: ... })` — three-arg form.
10. `api-endpoints.md` Auth Taxonomy table has exactly 4 rows (guest, handle-required, authenticated-session-required, admin-session-required).
11. Locked contract files byte-identical pre/post execution: `adminSession.ts`, `adminBilling.logic.ts`, `adminBilling.types.ts`, `billing.types.ts`, `sessionToken.logic.ts`, `sessionToken.types.ts`, `auth/hanko/**`.
12. The handler performs exhaustive result dispatch (no `default` branch, no `if (!result.ok)` short-circuit; all union variants `ok: true` / `'unauthorized'` / `'forbidden'` / `'lookup_failed'` handled explicitly).

## Vision Alignment

**Vision clauses touched:** §3 (Player Trust), §14 (No Silent Drift), §22 (Auditability).

**Conflict assertion:** No conflict. This WP **improves** vision alignment:
- §3: `requireAdminSession` attributes admin actions to a specific Hanko
  session + `is_admin` row, replacing an anonymous shared secret. Player
  trust improves because admin access is now per-user-auditable.
- §14: The cutover removes the D-11001 "temporary mechanism pending
  future RBAC" tech debt. No silent drift introduced.
- §22: Admin billing queries are now attributable to a specific
  `AccountId`, improving auditability over the shared-secret model.

**Non-Goal proximity check:** None of NG-1..7 are crossed. No
monetization, cosmetics, or paid-surface changes.

---

## Funding Surface Gate

N/A — this WP modifies an existing admin-only backoffice endpoint's
authentication mechanism. No UI surfaces, no user-visible copy, no
funding channels referenced. None of the §20.1 trigger surfaces are
present.

## Post-Merge Operator Action

After the execution PR merges and deploys to Render:

1. Navigate to Render dashboard → `legendary-arena-server` service → Environment.
2. **Delete** the `ADMIN_SECRET` environment variable. It is no longer
   read by any code path. Leaving it set is harmless but stale.
3. Verify the deploy succeeds and `/api/admin/billing/history` returns
   401 for unauthenticated requests (no session) and 200 for jeff's
   session.

---

## Bonus / Opportunistic (for execution session)

A stash exists on jeff's local machine (parked 2026-05-24) with a
`HANKO_JWKS_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS` parser hardening for `server.mjs`. The
cutover WP modifies `server.mjs` (the `registerAdminBillingRoutes`
wiring call). The execution session is a natural home to pop the stash
and include the hardening in the same EC-scoped commit if convenient.
This is OPTIONAL and must not block the cutover if the stash has
conflicts. The stash change MUST NOT modify any auth, routing, or
billing-related code paths defined in WP-176. If conflicts arise
with any WP-176 scope file, the stash must be abandoned without
blocking the WP.
